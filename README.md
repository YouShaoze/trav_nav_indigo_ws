## How to Install, Compile and Run

### Installing V-REP

1. Download version 3.2.2 (tested) from here <br />
    [GitHub Pages]http://coppeliarobotics.com/files/V-REP_PRO_V3_2_2_64_Linux.tar.gz <br />
    You don't need to compile anything. Just extract the files in your V-REP installation folder and you are ready to execute the main launcher (vrep.sh) from there. <br />

2. Set the environment variable VREP_ROOT_DIR: <br />
    add in your .bashrc the following line <br />
    <pre><code class="c"> export VREP_ROOT_DIR=<here you put the absolute path of your V-REP installation folder (which contains the launcher vrep.sh)> </code></pre>
